# CycleTracker
This project is a PWA tutorial provided by Mozilla.

## Summary
This intro-level tutorial walks through all the steps of building a basic progressive web app, or PWA. We will be using web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — to build a period tracking web app called "CycleTracker". Like all web apps, CycleTracker is designed to work in all browsers on all devices.
